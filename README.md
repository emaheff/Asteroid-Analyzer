# Asteroid Analyzer
Overview
Asteroid Insights: NASA Data Analysis is a Python-based project that analyzes NASA's asteroid dataset. The project provides tools for exploring and visualizing asteroid characteristics, orbit patterns, hazard classifications, and more. It includes functions for processing data, calculating statistics, and generating insightful visualizations.

Features
Data Loading and Filtering: Efficiently load and preprocess asteroid data.
Statistical Analysis:
Identify asteroids with extreme properties (e.g., largest/smallest diameters, closest to Earth).
Calculate averages and trends for asteroid characteristics.
Visualizations:
Histogram of asteroid diameters.
Pie chart of hazardous vs. non-hazardous asteroids.
Histogram of orbit intersections.
Linear regression between absolute magnitude and velocity.
Orbit Pattern Analysis: Explore common orbit IDs and their occurrences.
